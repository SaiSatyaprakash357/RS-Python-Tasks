# 1.Which if does the else belong to? Explain why ?

# if True:  
# if False :
#     print("A")
# else:
#     print("B")

# code has indentation error in first if
# we can't leave a if blank without indentated block 
# We need to write 'pass' if we want to skip it
# ignoring the error the else belongs to 2nd if
